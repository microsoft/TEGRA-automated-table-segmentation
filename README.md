# TEGRA-automated-table-segmentation


TEGRA is a research system developed at MSR, to automatically segment data that may not come with explitic column-delimiters (e.g., lists/tables on the web, and data embedded in texts), into relational tables. 

We develop an algorithm based on a concept we call ``global-alignment'', which can perform this task at high accuracy, as described in our SIGMOD 15 paper [TEGRA: Table Extraction by Global Record Alignment](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2723372.2723725) in detail.

This repo has the code used in our TEGRA paper, released under MIT licsense.
